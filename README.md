# MQC Project (Python, PostgreSQL)

## Project Overview
The MQC (MF Query Compiler) is a Python-based project that focuses on revolutionizing how SQL-like queries are interpreted and executed. This project was conducted from September to December 2023, aiming to enhance data manipulation efficiency in database interactions.

## Key Features

- **Innovative Query Interpretation:** Developed a unique system to interpret SQL-like queries, particularly featuring a novel "Such that" clause. This innovation simplifies the process of performing complex joins and subqueries, making data handling more efficient and user-friendly.

- **Script Generation System:** Implemented a sophisticated script generation mechanism. This system is capable of producing executable Python scripts which parallel the outputs of PostgreSQL, thereby streamlining the data retrieval process.

- **Enhanced Performance and Output Display:**
  - Utilized the `psycopg2` library, a popular PostgreSQL adapter for Python, ensuring robust database interaction and improved performance.
  - Integrated the `prettytable` library to provide a formatted and more readable output display, significantly enhancing the user experience when dealing with complex data sets.

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** Served as the primary programming language for building the core functionality of the query compiler and the script generation system.
- **PostgreSQL:** Used for managing and manipulating database interactions, demonstrating the application's effectiveness in real-world database environments.
- **psycopg2:** Enabled efficient and reliable communication between the Python application and the PostgreSQL database.
- **prettytable:** Assisted in presenting data in a structured and visually appealing format, facilitating easier analysis and interpretation.
